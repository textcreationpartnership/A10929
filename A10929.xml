            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At laſt (hauing with all, other ſpeciall reaſons moouing mee thereunto) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued vpon this courſe; And as by preaching, ſo by publiſhing ſome part of what I had taught in Print, to ſeeke Gods glory, his Churches good, and my owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and reioycing, in the day of the Lord Ieſus. I doe confeſſe I haue euer thought it, and ſtill doe thinke it, to be ſafer for me to follow Market nigher home, then to traffique abroad into other coaſts and countries with my <hi>Little;</hi> To ſpend my time in preaching, rather then in printing ſuch common ſtuffe as this. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ability of body (though not of minde) is
<pb facs="tcp:16592:3"/>
wanting, ſo that I cannot doe what otherwiſe I would; I am enforced to doe what I am able. And thus like a venturous young Merchant I launch forth into the deepe, aduenturing this my Ship vpon the dangerous and croſſe Seas of mens different opinions. I know I ſhall be toſſed with ſome ſtormie winds of euill cenſure, (though many would perſwade me I ſhall haue a faire gale, and a good voyage of it:) But here is my comfort, my Ship is ſound, and my tackling good, <hi>Hope</hi> is my <hi>Anchor,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> my <hi>Cable; Loue</hi> my <hi>Sailes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> my <hi>Pilot.</hi> I doubt not then but I ſhall ſaue my Veſſell, and bring it ſafe vnto the Hauen. What though I be ſomewhat ſea-ſicke in this my firſt voyage? I truſt it will be but as <hi>Phyſicke</hi> for mee, happily it will cauſe me to giue an eternall fare-well to all ſuch voyages, and make me reſolue neuer to thruſt my ſelfe into any more ſuch raſh aduentures.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I well remembred, how cenſorious the world is growne; ſo that no mans workes, how godly ſoeuer, lacketh ſome enuious calumniator and reproacher: and can I look to ſpeed better, then my betters haue ſped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me? Thirdly, I conſidered how many aged Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, haue refrained, and do yet refraine, from labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this kinde: Now for me to ſpeake, when they are ſilent, doth argue intolerable boldnes and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.

Fourthly,<note place="margin">Quam ſit mihi curta ſupellex.</note> I know my owne inſufficiencie, and am priuie to my owne weaknes, ingeniouſly confeſſing, I haue more neede to ſit at home, mending my nets, then thus to launch forth into the Ocean. Theſe many and weighty diſcouragements, did cauſe me for a time to with-hold the publiſhing of theſe Notes, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to withſtand the earneſt requeſts of ſome of my louing freinds for the printing of them.

Some are lame, and ſicke, and weake, and cannot come to the hearing of the word preached: now for ſuch to haue ſome plaine Expoſition or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon ſome part of Scripture, muſt needs be very comfortable and vſefull Yea, and in ſome reſpect, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may ſeeme to claime the priuiledge;<note place="margin">Quo liceat libris, non licet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this giueth a man leaue to pawſe vpon, and ponder on the things we haue heard deliuered: So that, though Preaching, moueth the Affections, and worketh more vpon them: yet Printing may be ſaid to teach more, and better to informe the iudgment. And ſo for our <hi>Memories;</hi> who findes not how leaking &amp; ſiue-like they are in reteyning of diuine truth? ſtrawes &amp; haires

indeed will theſe ſieues hold; ſome odd conceit or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken phraſe ſhall be remembred, when the pure water ſhall runne out: Sound ſolid matter ſhall be quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. But now by our often reading, things are brought againe into our mindes, and a long time retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in our memories; and what formerly wee haue heard deliuered, is as it were ſtill ſounding in our eares. Thirdly, I remembred, (what neuer can ſufficiently be bewailed) my time miſ-ſpent and loſt; which cauſed me to redeeme ſome time with the loſſe of my owne caſe and pleaſure, that I might doe good this way to Gods Church and people. And laſtly, the euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that ſome malignant ſpirits made of me, when I preached them, (<hi>viz.</hi> that I taught noueltie, and falſe Doctrine; and what I did, proceeded from a ſpirit of gall and bitternes, and the like,) hath much moued me to this worke. All theſe things being well weighed, did darken my former thoughts, and cauſed me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſe my Notes, and as I had time, to fit them for the Preſſe; which now I ſend into the world, deſiring the bleſſing of heauen to accompanie them, that they may be profitable.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Matter,</hi> I doubt not, but it is ſound and good, and how euer,<note place="margin">

               <hi>There is no new thing vnder the Sunne;</hi> And that there can be nothing ſayd, but what hath beene ſaid before, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> man could ſay;<note place="margin">Nihil eſt iam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, quod non ſit dictum prius.</note> yet there may be a more full opening, and a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous deliuering of poynts: yea, and daily is, to the great benefit of the Church of God, though happily in regard of the ſumme and ſubſtance of matters; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſaying may be true. I cannot then here promiſe thee (Chriſtian Reader) any new thing, which thou haſt not before heard of; but this I can promiſe thee, though nothing els; Thou haſt here this <hi>Parable</hi> handled more amply and fully, then (to my knowledge) thou euer haſt had it heretofore, for I know not any that haue trauailed throughout in the opening of it. I doe confeſſe, I (with

the little Bee) haue flowne ouer many a Garden, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked many a flower for this little, and haue beene behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to many an Author, both old and new, for ſome matter and ſtuffe, towards the erecting of this building. But blame me not for this, ſeeing I haue done no other then all other <hi>Expoſitors</hi> haue done before me; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all haue laboured by enlargement to make thoſe things as vſefull to thee, as I could.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>ſtyle,</hi> it is plaine and homely (though I truſt not ouerhomely) I haue euer deſired, (and I hope for euer ſhall) ſo to ſpeake, as that the ſimpleſt might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ayming in all my teaching, at that to which the whole Scripture driues, viz <hi>Humilitie, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of obedience.</hi>

And to be plaine, he hath no skill in crooked conceits; which if he had, yet he would be loath to ſpend his time ſo idly, as to feed that itching humour of many, which hath more need to be purged then to be nouriſhed. But to be briefe, ſeeing that this booke is come into thy hands, let me deſire thee, firſt, to read it through; begin not onely but make an end: thou knoweſt not, the beſt wine may be reſerued vntill the laſt.<note place="margin">

               <p>In this Chapter; Chriſt vſeth this dark kind of teaching, propounding three parables, which are as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of muſicke, playing one and the ſame tune: In that of the loſt ſheepe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.-8.

               </p>
               <p>His ſcope and drift in it is to conuince them of ſinne,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16592:12"/>
for this their ſo doing, and to bring them to a ſight of it, and Repentance for it: for which end and purpoſe hee doth vſe two Arguments, both taken from Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling The firſt may be thus framed;</p>

               <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is prooued, and illuſtrated in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this parable: where, by the readineſſe of the Father to receiue his ſonne, he ſheweth the readineſſe of the Lord to receiue penitents.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument he vſeth, is this, <hi>If God diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> he cleareth and illuſtrateth in the latter part of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; by ſhewing how the Father reprehendeth his ſonne, for that his murmuring. And thus wee haue ſeene the ſcope and intent.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The vſe of this Parable.</note>This Parable is of excellent vſe to the Church &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: it ſetteth forth vnto vs our decayed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored eſtate; our decayed eſtate through our wilful diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and manifold tranſgreſſions; through our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall corruption and actuall aberration; Our reſtored eſtate, in our conuerſion to God, by true and vnfained Repentance, in a holy life and godly obedience.</p>

The external ſound of the letter is the body, but the true ſence and meaning is the ſoule of it: wee will therefore, ſeeke out the ſence and meaning, and leaue the letter.</p>
               <p>The Fathers, and other Interpreters make this the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall expoſition of this parable. The Father is God, the two <hi>Sonnes</hi> are the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies</hi> (who are meant by the elder) and <hi>Publicanes</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> ſignified by the younger: the farre country wherein this prodigall wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is the region of ſinne, wherein they liued: the goods which he waſted, were thoſe common gifts and graces which were beſtowed on them: the Famine be ſuſtained was the want of that bread of eternall life, whereof they were depriued; the Citizen he cleaued to, was the Prince of darkneſſe, who rules in the hearts of the children of diſobedience: the <hi>Swine</hi> he kept, were reprobate and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones, with whom they accompanied: the <hi>huskes</hi> which rather burdened then relieued his ſtomacke, were the vanities of this world (or rather the traditions and frothy doctrines of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſies</hi>) which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloyed then ſatisfied their hungry ſoules: his returne home, was their returne from ſinne by repentance: by <hi>robe, ring, ſhoes,</hi> and <hi>calfe,</hi> are ſignified the riches of Gods graces, whereby he ſupplyed all their wants: the <hi>ſeruants</hi> who are willed to fetch theſe, are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Gods word, who bring his graces to vs: the <hi>banquet, mirth,</hi> and <hi>muſicke,</hi> doth repreſent that ioy and happineſſe which neither eye hath ſeene, eare hath heard, neither can the heart of man conceiue of. Each of theſe we ſhall further proue in their ſeuerall places.</p>

               <p>In the prodigall, his <hi>Regreſſe;</hi> there, we haue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ver. 17-22. And the ſucceſſe therof, from the 22. verſe vnto the end: in his repentance, conſider theſe three ſpecials; firſt, the motiues, or occaſion thereof; which was, firſt in generall, a communing with himſelfe, and calling his wayes to account; or ſecondly, a more ſpeciall &amp; particular conſideration, and that of his owne miſery. <hi>I periſh with hunger:</hi> and of his Fathers mercie; <hi>How many hired ſeruants of my Fathers haue bread enough</hi> verſe 15.

His brothers ill will, that is laid downe in the 25.26.27. verſes, with the reſt vnto the end; where we ſee, firſt from what it ariſeth, viz. from the vnderſtanding of his fathers loue, verſe 25-29.

And thirdly, how it is qualified, viz. by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entreatie of kindneſſe, verſe 28. Secondly, by his Fathers reproofe of vnkindneſſe, verſe 31. Thus we ſee the tree and braunches, now to the fruit.</p>
               <p>We might gather many good inſtructions out of this parable, if we ſhould conſider it according to the letter,<note place="margin">Inſtructions might be brought from the letter of the parable. <hi>Parabola enim de nullo non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenit.</hi>
                  </note> which I cannot ſee but we haue liberty to doe; for Chriſt borrowes no ſimilitude from that which is not, and the things from whence the ſimilitude is fetched, is the ſame in it ſelfe, for which it is brought to illuſtrate another. So then it might be handled without regarding the ſimile, as if it were a plaine narration, as <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.1.2.<note place="margin">

               <p>And firſt, from the ſcope and drift of Chriſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of it, which was (as yee haue heard) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them, and bring them to a ſight of their ſinne, and ſo to repentance.<note place="margin">

I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there may be, and often is, a great fault on the right hand in harping too much on this ſad ſtring of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some there are indeede who are neuer well, but when damnation doth end their ſentence; this is too bloudy and butcherly a kinde of teaching. But yet let me tell you: We now liue in ſuch times wherein a ſermon of mercy is like a dead letter; there are thouſands who are not worthy to heare of mercy, not to heare the ſound of the word, much leſſe to heare the doctrine of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes taught. Now what courſe muſt bee taken with theſe?

And as for thee, who thus condemneſt the Miniſters of the Lord, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering of the terrours of the law, &amp; art euer calling for goſpell, goſpell; I tell thee, it is to be feared, of all others thou art moſt vnfit to heare it, for it is vſually ſeen, none call more for it to be taught, then ſuch as moſt deſpiſe it and condemne it, thoſe that are loath to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are euer loath to heare the law deliuered.

So is it with a ſinner, while he is in the eſtate of nature, he ſeeth nothing, no wrath, no iudgement, no hell, for the God of this world hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his eyes, and therefore walketh on boldly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in ſin, he ſeeth not the narrowneſſe of the bridge of this life, nor the fearefull gulfe of hell vnder it, which he falls immediately into if he flies off: but when God ſhall open his eyes, and touch his heart to conſider of his eſtate, and ſee himſelfe; then hee ſeeth how narrow the bridge of this life is, then hee ſeeth hell the gaping gulfe vnder it, and how little a ſteppe there is betweene him and damnation; then he woonders at his deſperate boldneſſe, which ſo ſecurely plodded on to deſtruction; and bleſſeth God for keeping him from falling into hell, then hee leaueth his former wayes, and turnes his heart vnto the Lord who hath thus preſerued him, and will not by any meanes goe the way hee went before. And thus, vntill mens eyes are opened, there will bee no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, before their conuiction there is no hope of conuerſion.</p>

But if on the other ſide, thou art deſirous to be reſtrained, and thou counteſt it a miſerie not to haue thy fleſh bridled, if thou art willing to drawe in Chriſts yoke, and takeſt delight in obeying of his will: thou mayſt then conclude, and that without feare, that thy holineſſe is ſound and vnfained, and ſo conſequently, that thou art (not onely a member of the Church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) but alſo a true member of the Church catholike and inuiſible: oh my beloued, that wee would deale truely with our ſelues, that we would now at the laſt learne to be wiſe, and not gull our owne ſoules, as moſt doe.

               <p>A ſecond ſort to be reproued, are many ignorant, and proud Proteſtants (and in this point very Papiſts) who, eſteeme of, and lay claime to Gods gifts, whether tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or eternall, as to a debt owing to them: alas, how common is this with the ſonnes of men?

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> In the third and laſt place, this doctrine will affoorde much comfort to the children of God, for as God doth thus puniſh according to the manner of our ſinning, ſo will he reward according to the manner and meaſure of our walking. Many notable examples are recorded in Scriptures, of Gods gracious dealing in this kinde alſo towards thoſe that haue beene obedient, for our comfort and encouragement. The widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued the Prophet of the Lord, wherefore God relieued her and her whole family,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.16. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 39.18.</note> for <hi>the meale waſted not, neither did the oyle faile.</hi> So <hi>Ebed-melech</hi> ſaued the life of <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and therefore had his owne life giuen him as a prey. Many other examples might bee brought. Oh how ſhould this incourage vs to all good workes! What a ſpurre would this be if it were well conſidered to well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Let it be conſidered of vs, and let it ſtirre vs vp to do good to gods Church, and people: Doe good to them, thou doſt good to thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">

               <p>This is generall. Now we might here further take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the curſed diſpoſition of the wicked, who though they be miſerable in regard they are ſtrangers from the life of God, yet doe they not know their miſery, vntill by want of earthly comforts they be brought to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

his miſery vntill now: and now hauing loſt all, and conſumed his portion, it is ſaid, <hi>he began to be in neceſſity;</hi> that is, he began to feele himſelfe to be in miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus then it often falleth out,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that ſo long as Gods creatures are enioyed, the great want of God himſelfe is not felt. But of this I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more, when I come to ſpeake of the occaſion or motiues of his conuerſion. Now then to the next verſe.</p>

See this prooued in the example of the Iſraelites; who being afflicted for their ſinnes, and hedged in with troubles and grieuous afflictions, runne vnto their Idols, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after their louers, hoping and expecting deliuerance from them.

               <p>The vſe we are to make of this poynt is manifold; firſt, it may ſerue to ſhew vs the curſed and malignant qualitie of ſinnes: which <hi>Circes</hi> like doth transforme men into beaſts, and maketh thoſe who at the beginning were made after Gods owne Image moſt glorious and beautifull, to be more vgly in the ſight of God then the moſt brutiſh creature that he hath made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may teach vs how to eſteeme of the wicked, ſurely as God himſelfe eſteemes of them, no better then of beaſts; nay, well were it for them, if they were no worſe, for when the beaſt dies, his miſery ends, but when theſe die, their vnhappineſſe begins: Theſe are the heard of vncleane Swine, whereinto to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil is entred, and will at length fling them into that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe Lake.</p>

What man would indure to be called a beaſt, to be termed an Aſſe, an Owle, a Dogge, or the like? yet the brutiſh practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of many, ſhew they are no better. How many liue like Swine, rooting in the earth, trampling vnder their feet the holy things of God? contemning the Word and Sacraments, and wallow in the myre of vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and drunkenneſſe? How many reſemble the Horſe and Mule, who will not indure bit or bridle, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can curbe them or keepe them in compaſſe? mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, iudgements, promiſes, threatnings, all are too little, their Rider they will caſt, and giue him a farewell with their heeles, ſuch iadiſh trickes too many vſe. What a number of two-leg'd Dogges are abroad in the world of all ſorts and kinds? ſome reſemble the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffe, worrying Chriſts Lambes, by grinding the faces of the poore; ſome haue the qualitie of the Spaniell, fawning and flattering, good for nothing but to fetch and carrie; tale-bearers, buſie-bodies: Others, of the Greyhound, out-running all moderation, running in all exceſſe of riot, ſpending on backe and belly their whole patrimonie: There are many alſo reſemble your bawling Curres, Raylers, Reuilers of God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And as many the Bloud-hound, perſecuters of the Saints and ſeruants of God, who are neuer well till they haue their bloud to drinke.

Baſſinet.</note> and what is wanting one way, they ſupply another. Let the words of a learned man, be an anſwer to this. In former times, it was as great a wonder to heare a Biſhop preach, as to ſee an Aſſe to flye (as one of their owne ſide in a publique Oration before the Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Aninion</hi> did teſtifie:<note place="margin">What doctrine Papiſts teach.</note>) Now indeed they preach more then heretofore, but their Doctrine ſauours of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie more then of pietie, tending rather to King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then ſoule ſauing. Their Diuinitie tracts are worſe then their humane learning; and their Sermons are the worſt of all Diuinity; being ſtuffed with lying legends, and not according to the wiſdome of Gods Law.</p>
               <p>The Ieſuites (ſaith my former Author) (alluding to the words of <hi>Seneca</hi>) in their preaching are <hi>male A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes,</hi> as making merchandize of Gods holy Word.<note place="margin">Magna vitae pars, elabitur malè agentibus, maxima nihil agentibus, rota aliud agentibus.

               <p>As this is their dealing with the Word, ſo the like is their dealing with them about the Sacraments: for whereas Chriſt bequeathed both the Bread and the Wine, to his Church, and prepared a full meale for his

               <p>Secondly, they ſay, the Wine is in danger of ſpilling, but there is leſſe danger of the bread.</p>

               <p>I anſwer, Onely ſo much is conſecrated as we receiue; and no more is the Sacramentall ſigne: for to proue this: That water that the people of Irael drunke, was ſacramentall water: And that only, and no more, I hope none will ſay, that that which the cattle drunke, was ſuch alſo.</p>

bringeth death: For heare is the difference. The ſorrow of him that is truly penitent,<note place="margin">Malum peccati.</note> is moſt conuerſant about the euill of his ſinne; and is more for Gods cauſe then for his owne; more that God is offended, then for any manner of reſpect vnto himſelfe.

               </p>
               <p>Now the ſorrow of him whoſe repentance is vnſound, is of another nature, and is principally occupied about the <hi>euill of puniſhment.</hi> Being more for there owne ſakes then for Gods.<note place="margin">Malum paenae.</note> There ſinne hath no place in their ſorrow, nor God offended.

Why, this is an excellent ſigne, a neuer-failing ſigne of thy ſound ſorrow; this is a certaine teſtimonie to thy ſoule, that thy griefe is vnto life, and that thou art a childe of God. Oh! let theſe things bee well thought on, and often remembred, and let vs often ſearch our hearts by them, that wee may know what wee are, and what ſorrow we haue, whether godly or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Without queſtion many of Gods children want that ſound comfort which they might and ſhould haue for want of this ſearch and triall; for without it, it cannot bee but wee muſt remaine either in errour or in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.<label type="milestone">

               <p>Now, in the third place this may ſerue for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, yea, for the terrour of many, who reſt in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and vnſound repentance. For, doth a true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent grieue more for Gods cauſe then for his owne; is he more grieued for the offence againſt God, then for any manner of reſpect vnto himſelfe? Then ſurely ſuch are farre from true repentance, who (were it not for feare
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16592:84"/>
or ſhame) could be content to liue in ſinne, and tumble in it all their daies. A kind of ſorrow indeed many haue, but it is onely worldly, ſlauiſh, diuelliſh; their reſpect is wholly to themſelues, to God nothing. They loath ſin, but not becauſe God abhorres it; they grieue, but not becauſe God is diſpleaſed by it; but becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make their parties good enough againſt him, in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of their ſinnes, and preuenting of his iudgements. Who almoſt makes conſcience of ſecret ſinnes? Where is he that grieues for leſſe euils? that mournes &amp; grieues for his omiſſion of good, and neglect of duties God hath required? for fewe are there that ſigh and crie for the abhominations committed in our ſhops and ſtreetes: ſhould God ſend his Angell through this Citie, to marke thoſe that thus mourne;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek</hi> 9.4.</note> how ſmall would be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that receiue the marke? How many of vs haue this deſire rather to be freed from ſinne then any other croſſe, &amp; are as willing not to commit it, as to haue the Lord not to impute it? Can we then thinke that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is ſo common as the world takes it to be? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſurely, theſe things doe teſtifie to our faces that wee are farre from it. Be it knowne therefore vnto thee, thou that mourneſt not for thy ſecret corruptions, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineſt not from ſecret ſinnes, that grieueſt not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſinne, aſwell as for thy own, thou that haſt not this earneſt deſire to be ridde from all ſinne whatſoeuer; be it knowne vnto thee (I ſay) and certified to thy ſoule, that though thou doeſt mourne and grieue, and art ſorrie thou haſt done amiſſe, and alſo couldſt wiſh that many things could againe bee recalled which thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; yet thy ſorrow is vnſound, it is but a heauie and comfortleſſe ſorrow, and the beginning of ſorrowes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting.

               <p>Secondly, we are to know, the practiſe of <hi>Repentance</hi> (being an act of the affections) cauſeth a man to iudge, and ſpeake of himſelfe, according to the truth of that he doth conceiue and feele to be in himſelfe, and ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ſence, to make his faults with the moſt, rather then with the leaſt. And this a man may doe, and yet be within the compaſſe of the truth of his own conceiuing, though beyond the extent of the truth of his ſinnes, in themſelues exactly conſidered. And thus did the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeake, according to his ſence, and thought himſelfe to be inferiour vnto all. And thus much for this Queſtion, as alſo for this doctrine.

God onely (ſay they) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the will, as a man his friend, to take a iourney, whereto he is vnwilling: but in the accompliſhing of any worke, God is onely an aſſiſtant, for man by his owne power worketh together with him. This is little better then blaſphemie thus to hold, that the will of man doth worke with Gods grace in any thing, that is good. True it is, as they are workes and actions, ſo they proceede from the will of man; but as they are good workes, ſo onely are they workes of grace: For all actions of man may be diſtinguiſhed into three ſorts: ſome are naturall, as to eate, drinke, walke, ſleepe, &amp;c. Now moſt true it is, that in theſe and the like actions, man hath freedome of will, but yet ſo, as that he hath onely power to the doing, but not to the well-doing; hee is not able to doe any of theſe things, to any good or godly end: he may vſe the meanes to obtaine faith, and repentance: he may goe from place to place: he may enter into the houſe of God, or not enter, heare the Word, or not heare it; for this is left to man, and put as it were into our hands; but it is to make vs without excuſe; for ſo to heare as that thereby our conuerſion might be wrought, is not in our power: It is the Lord that muſt firſt boare the care.</p>
                  <p>Other kind of actions are morall; as all oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and Politicall duties. In theſe, man hath no free will of himſelfe, to chuſe the good, or refuſe the euill: to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the vertue, or decline the vice: but as he is wholly directed and gouerned by Gods ſpirit. Laſtly, other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſpirituall: wherein we are to conſider man with a three-fold difference. Firſt, as he is before his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16592:122"/>
where his will is altogether corrupt, inclining onely to that which is euill. Secondly, as he is in the very act of conuerſion, where in reſpect of the grace, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly preuents him, his will is meerely paſſiue; and hee is in the hands of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21.</note> euen as the clay in the hands of the potter, but yet in reſpect of the time, wherein his conuerſion is wrought, he is not like a ſtocke, but while he is healed by the holy Ghoſt, he is alſo actiue. In the very act of conuerſion, the will of man is not idle, nor without all motion and ſence, but it followeth,<note place="margin">Acti agimus.</note> the ſpirit of God, that draweth it far more, and the ſame moment God mooueth and boweth the will, and cauſeth vs to be willing indeed; but yet ſo as all the efficacie of the worke is from the ſpirit of God; who of vnwilling, maketh vs willing: and maketh vs runne, who were before ſlow and dull.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, man is to be conſidered, as he is after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion: where, becauſe the grace of God beareth rule, there is a readineſſe to obey, as the Apoſtle ſheweth to the <hi>Phillippians, I am able to doe all things through Chriſt,</hi>

                     <hi>who ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> So then we ſee the truth of this doctrine, how we haue no abilitie to cooperate (as they falſly teach) with the grace of God: freedome of the will to turne to God, and to worke with him, is no power of nature, but the worke of grace: For of our ſelues we are not ſufficient, as of our ſelues, to <hi>thinke,</hi> much leſſe to <hi>ſpeake;</hi> leſt of all, <hi>to doe any good:</hi> Indeed we will, but it is God that worketh in vs to will; we worke, but it is God that worketh in vs to worke, according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.4.</note> For this the Apoſtle doth commend the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> in that their loue was not partiall, but reached towards all the Saints, as well as vnto any. Such therefore as pretend loue to one and not vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, let their pretence be what it will; let them profeſſe and ſay, they loue them for the truth; yet they doe but deceiue themſelues, for their loue is not ſound, but grounded on ſome by reſpect, &amp; for ſome carnal end: it may be they loue them for their gifts, but not for their graces, I dare ſay. For it is impoſſible to loue a Saint as a Saint, but we muſt loue euery Saint. Thus may we try the ſoundnes of our loue towards Gods children, which if vpon examination, we find to be true, then may wee make this as a ſure ſigne &amp; manifeſt token of Gods loue to vs; for loue them, &amp; be beloued of him. More ſignes might be brought, whereby a Chriſtian may aſſuredly know, whether God hath as yet <hi>kiſſed him with the kiſſes of his mouth;</hi> but theſe are enough (and I deſire not to ſay all I can, but enough) to make this knowne vnto vs: take then ſome paines in examination, and it will ſtraight way appeare.

enlightned thy mind, and ſanctified thy ſoule? Hath it wrought a change and alteration in thy courſe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage?

Doſt thou delight in his preſence, ſtill hauing recourſe vnto him, by thoſe bleſſed meanes, both publike &amp; priuate, by which he is pleaſed to conuerſe with men? And art thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to goe vnto him? Canſt thou ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>Come, euen come Lord Ieſus come quickly?</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.17.20</note> tell me art thou deſirous to pleaſe him, and obey him?

Couldeſt thou be content to ſuffer the ſpoyling of thy goods? the loſſe of libertie, yea, and of life (if need ſhould require) that he might thereby be glorified? Moreouer, is it the deſire of thy ſoule to be conformable vnto him in holineſſe and puritie? Doeſt thou loue, what he loues? and hateſt thou what he hates? And laboureſt thou to be perfect, <hi>euen as he is perfect?</hi> Surely, if it be thus, thy eſtate is good, thou loueſt God, and he thee. But proceed we yet further in this ſearch, (for a good thing cannot be made too ſure) and tell me, loueſt thou Gods Saints and ſeruants, and that truely and entirely? Is not thy loue grounded on ſome carnall end? is it not ſome by-reſpect that cauſeth it? Is it for their pietie and godlineſſe, thou ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt them? Doth the very report thou heareſt made of them, for their vertues, enkindle loue in thy heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou haſt had no knowledge of them, nor dealing with them? And doeſt thou eſteeme of theſe as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent ones vpon the earth, chuſing them for thy beſt companions, receiuing them into thy ſocietie? And is thy loue totall, to all as well as vnto any? Loueſt thou euery Saint aſwell as any Saint? Is thy affection towards the poore, as well as to the rich? is thy heart vpon them in aduerſitie, as well as in proſperitie? If it be thus with
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16592:134"/>
thee, thou then loueſt Gods Saints indeed, with a loue vnfained, and (vndoubtedly) art beloued of him, who is the father of them. But if thou beeſt wholly voyd of theſe things, thy loue is no true loue, but ſuch a loue as may be found in any vnregenerated perſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus by a diligent examination of your ſelues, you may ſoone determine, and alſo ſoundly; whether God hath manifeſted his loue towards thee. Spend ſome time therefore in this matter, it will not be time miſpent, but redeemed, much benefit wil redound to vs by our paines thus beſtowed: for the ſurer ground thou art of, the more comfort thou wilt haue: and without doubt many of Gods children depriue themſelues of much comfort, for want of a daily examination of themſelues, by theſe and the like notes; and oftentimes fal into doubting of Gods loue and fauour, which in time prooueth pernicious to their ſoules.</p>

               <p>Secondly, I anſwer, this is not mentioned to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, but ſpoken to her praiſe; ſhee is not vpbraided with it, but commended, in that ſhe had forſaken it. We ſee hereby what ſhee was before her calling, but ſhee is not reproched with it now after her calling; ſhe is now no longer a harlot, but a true beleeuer with the people of God: ſo then it tends not to her defaming, but to ſhew the greatnes of Gods compaſſion, and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of her conuerſion.</p>
               <p>Now for the Vſe which we may make of this truth:<label type="milestone">

make vs ſpeedily turne vnto the Lord. Art thou a drunkard, an vncleane perſon, a filthy liuer? take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Gods mercifull dealing with this prodigall, who is ſet out for a patterne to all them that are deſirous to come home; ſee how (vpon his repentance) he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced; how liberall his father is towards him; as if from his very cradle he had crept on his hands &amp; knees to pleaſe him: here are no old <hi>items,</hi> no back recknings brought in, but all is forgiuen and forgotten, as if there were no fault done; he is as royally entertained, as if he had bin the dutifulleſt ſonne that euer the earth bare. Well; thus will God deale with thee, he will neuer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid thee with thy drunkennes, with thy ſwearing, with thy whoring, with thy theeuing, nor with any other of thy lewd courſes.

Let vs learne to put a difference betwixt time paſt and time preſent: the Apoſtle reckoning vp many horrible ſinnes committed by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the time of their vnregeneracie, maketh a flat oppoſition betweene their eſtate before their calling, and that after, <hi>Such were ſome of you,</hi>

Shall we ſay he that is come to mans eſtate is a babe, becauſe he was ſo? or he that is now a freeman is

Oh then beware how you eſteeme of any by the time paſt, or caſt the filth of their former ſinnes into their faces, when God hath wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped them away.

                  </note> though not of the Law of the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, yet of the Law of God, which binds vs to obey the Magiſtrates law (it not being contrary to Gods) and to be obedient to thoſe that are ſet ouer vs.</p>
               <p>Here it may be demaunded, whether a man may eat fleſh at ſuch times, as the Magiſtrate hath forbidden it?</p>
               <p>To this Queſtion, this anſwere hath beene made. Lawes made by the Magiſtrate, are of two ſorts, eyther <hi>mixt,</hi> or elſe <hi>meerely poenall.</hi> Mixt lawes are thoſe which are of weightie matters, and are propounded in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding termes: Now lawes of this kinde bind men, firſt, to <hi>obedience:</hi> ſecondly to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> if they obey not. If a man breake theſe kind of Lawes, though he be willing to ſuffer the puniſhment, yet is not his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence diſcharged of the ſinne before God, for his Law binds not onely to ſubiection in bearing puniſhment, but to obedience of the bare commaundement, it being (as I ſayd before) lawfull and agreeable to Gods will.</p>
               <p>For the other ſort, viz. ſuch as are meerely <hi>poenall,</hi> they are thoſe, which (being made of matters of leſſe moment and importance, and not vttered nor deliuered in ſuch commanding termes) doe onely declare and ſhew what is to be done, or conditionally require this or that, with reſpect vnto the puniſhment; as if the Magiſtrate ſhould ſay, if you doe this, then you ſhall forfeit thus much, now chuſe you whether: ſo that this kind of law doth eſpecially bind vnto the puniſhment, and therefore hee that is readie (omitting this law) to beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, freeth himſelfe from ſinne before the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he goeth not contrary to the intent of the Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

               <p>The intent of the Magiſtrate is not to impaire the health of any ſubiect, but the preſeruation of it; to ſuch therefore they giue liberty, and they may eat, if neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty require. Let this then ſerue briefly for an anſwer to this queſtion; as alſo for the time when wee are to vſe our liberty in this kinde.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Sanctifie</hi> the creatures thou doeſt receiue, deſire God to giue a bleſſing with them: <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothing to bee refuſed, if it bee receiued with thankeſgiuing: For it is ſanctified by the Word of God and prayer.</hi> Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee was in the ſhip, <hi>Hee tooke bread, and gaue thankes to God in preſence of them all,</hi> and then beganne to eat. And thus did Chriſt himſelfe, who would not eat of the fiue loaues and two fiſhes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had looked vp to Heauen, and called for a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>

It was taxed in <hi>Nabal,</hi> that (being but a Country-Farmer) he feaſted it like a King. Be frugall in thy feaſting, remembring alwayes, honeſt delight conſiſts not ſo much in hauing many diſhes, as in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16592:144"/>
hauing of the ſweeteſt, and of the fatteſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beware of eating to exceſſe or riot:<note place="margin">Thirdly, that we feede with ſobriety, and not to exceſſe.</note> For God alloweth vs a liberall vſe of the creatures, not to hurt, but helpe our ſelues; to refreſh and not oppreſſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make vs fit, and not vnfit for holy duties.

               <p>But thus is this Queſtion anſwered; A deformity may be couered, but a new forme may not be ſet vpon the face; neither a new habit on the bodie. The outward forme and fauour that man hath, is the worke of God himſelfe, fitted and proportioned vnto man in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, by his ſpeciall prouidence: Now to take in hand to mend this fauor, or proportion, that God hath giuen: what is it; but firſt highly to diſhonour God, by preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to adulterate his worke, taking vpon them to amend that which as they ſuppoſe he hath made amiſſe? yea,

                     <p>Thirdly, this is to be aſhamed of the worke of Gods hands, which if we be, God will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of vs, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge vs for his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth notably confirme this in the ſecond to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the words be theſe, <hi>You, hath he quickened,</hi>

But doth not the Scripture tell vs that by nature wee are dead? not in a ſwond or ſicke, but dead, ſtarke dead, as I haue formerly ſhewed. And what can ſuch a one doe to his owne quickening? no, no, this cannot bee, for of our ſelues wee cannot moue to life, vntill God doe quicken vs by his Word and Spirit.</p>

Try then your ſelues, by this firſt propertie, is it thus with thee? Art thou employed in Gods ſeruice, doſt thou find grace actiue, and ſtirring in thee? ſurely then it is a good ſigne of life: but if it be ſo, that there is no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall motion, it is an euident ſigne of the want hereof.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:16592:155"/>
An image made by mans art, may liuely repreſent a man hauing eyes, and eares, noſe, and mouth, as man hath; yet I know, for all that it hath no life in it, becauſe it ſtands ſtill, and ſtirs not: So, if I ſee a profeſſor, without practiſe in his life, I muſt needs thinke he is an <hi>Idoll;</hi> And aſſuredly what euer they ſeeme in the eyes of men, they are in the eyes of God, but as the carkaſes of Chriſtians. Without this ſpirituall diſpoſition to ſpirituall exerciſes, pretend what thou wilt, thou art but the Image of a Chriſtian, looking ſomewhat like him, but not quickned by his life.</p>
               <p>A ſecond propertie of life is this;<note place="margin">Second pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, it euer ſeekes it owne preſeruation.</note> It will euer ſeeke it owne preſeruation: The new borne babe, by crying begs helpe preſently, ſo ſoone as it is borne: And the young ones of bruites, run to the teat of their dames: Thus it is with ſuch as liue this life of grace, they hunger and thirſt for the food of their ſoules,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</note> and <hi>as new borne babes deſire the ſincere milke of the word, that they may grow thereby,</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> teacheth vs. Their deſire is to be feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they may be growing, and they are much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when this food is wanting, becauſe the growth of grace muſt needs be hindered. Examine thy ſelfe, is it thus with thee, doeſt thou deſire after the food of thy ſoule? and follow hard the market, to prouide for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ſame? If it be ſo, it is well, it is a great ſigne of grace: but if it be otherwiſe, that thou haſt no care hereof, deſpiſing or neglecting the ordinances of God, which he hath ordained for the good of thy ſoule, it is a ſure ſigne thou wanteſt this life we ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>A third propertie is conſtantly to ſeeke it.<note place="margin">Thirdly, as it ſeeketh it, ſo it conſtantly ſeekes it.</note> Life doth not onely ſeeke it owne preſeruation, but it ſeeks it daily, conſtantly, &amp; continually, ſo long as it hath any being. The yong infant doth almoſt nothing elſe but ſuck and ſleepe, then cry for the breaſt againe: and ſo any other creature, doth daily ſeeke for foode: The young lyons roare after their prey,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.21. <hi>Ver.</hi> 27.</note> and all other creatures <hi>waite vpon the Lord, that he may giue them their meat in due ſeaſon.</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:16592:156"/>
Thus is it with them that liue this life of grace; there is a daily ſeeking after foode for the preſeruing of it; a daily vſing of the meanes, as <hi>prayer, reading, meditation,</hi> and the like. Thus it is ſaid of the bleſſed man; <hi>In Gods law he doth exerciſe himſelfe both day and night.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2.</note> Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be brought for proofe of this. <hi>Iob</hi> roſe vp early to offer ſacrifice:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 1.5.</note> this did <hi>Iob</hi> continually. It was <hi>Daniels</hi> practiſe to pray three times a day.<note place="margin">

And indeed there are but few du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, for which we haue not the example of ſome Saint for the daily performance thereof. Let this be well conſidered of ſuch as heare and read and pray by fitts and ſtarts, now and then, as it were vpon raynie dayes. Alas! thouſands there are in the world, who read not, pray not from Sabboth to Sabboth, nay nor then neither. Haue theſe any life of grace in them? Sure I am, naturall life muſt be daily fed, and ſhall be too; and is there not as much neede for the ſpirituall? Be it therefore knowne vnto thee, and certified to thy ſoule, that thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, in thinking thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt the life of a Chriſtian, when there is no care had to a daily performance of the exerciſes belonging to a Chriſtian.</p>

                  <hi>who ſhall deliuer me from the bodie of this death?</hi> Thus was he ſenſible of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which was made by ſinne, againſt that life and power of grace which was in him: and as he felt it, ſo did he warre and combat againſt it; he did reſiſt thoſe rebellious luſts, and ſet himſelfe againſt them with all his force. Examine then thy ſelfe by this: Doeſt thou feele thy corruptions, and ſtriue againſt them? Art thou ſenſible of the working of ſinne in thy ſelfe, and how it oppoſeth the life of grace that is in thee? Doeſt thou feele vnbeleefe oppoſing thy faith? Dulneſſe and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thy delight in Gods ſeruice? And doeſt thou ſtruggle and ſtriue againſt each of theſe, as the powers of life naturall, doth againſt a diſeaſe? Why then this is an euident ſigne of ſpirituall life; a ſure teſtimonie of the Spirit of Grace. But is it otherwiſe with thee? haſt thou no ſenſe nor feeling of the power of ſinne? makeſt thou no complaints againſt thy ſinfull corruptions? Is there no reſiſting nor oppoſing of thy rebellious luſts? Why then aſſure thy ſelfe there is no life of grace in thee: the ſtrong man hath gone away with all, &amp; thou art ſtill in thy naturall blindnes and deadnes.</p>
               <p>By theſe ſignes may you certainely know (if you will deale truely in examining your ſelues) whether you as yet liue the life of Grace: Deale faithfully then with thy ſelfe in this buſineſſe, which doth ſo neerely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne thee. For if thou liueſt not the life of Grace here, neuer hope to liue the life of glory hereafter. As deſirous (therefore) as thou art to know the one, ſo be as diligent to finde out the other.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, they hauing right to the promiſe. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, their names being written in the booke of life. <hi>Luke</hi> 10 20.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commands them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.11. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly by many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſuch as haue reioyced. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>Eſay</hi> 25.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 38.19.20.21.</p>
                  </note>The ſecond ſort that are to be reprooued, are world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and prophane perſons, who thinke that grace doth driue out and kill all affections, eſpecially that of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> They thinke there is no ioy nor mirth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto a Chriſtian; but when men once beginne to liue godly, they muſt giue a farewell, and bid adieu to all mirth and gladneſſe whatſoeuer, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to a mopiſh, heauy, lumpiſh, and ſolitary life, as their common prouerb teſtifieth. But this is a foule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Deuill, whereby he labours to put godlineſſe out of countenance: for grace doth not aboliſh this, nor any other affection. Chriſtians haue their ioy as well as others haue, they doe reioyce as much and more, then any other doe or can; and indeed none haue cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce but they. For firſt, they onely haue their ſinnes pardoned, they onely are ſet free from thoſe infinite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which are fruits of ſinne, wherewith all others are beſet: From <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> are they deliuered, and therefore haue cauſe of ioy. Secondly, they, and they onely, haue right to all Gods promiſes, that concerne this life, or a better. Thirdly, they, and they only, haue a certaine aſſurance, that their names are written in the booke of life, wherin they haue greater cauſe to reioyce, then if they had the Deuils in ſubiection to them. Fourthly, they, and they onely, haue peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a continuall feaſt, and makes men glad and cheerefull. Fiftly, theſe, and theſe onely, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably performe good duties, and are conuerſant in good exerciſes, which are the Wels of conſolation, theſe onely haue pitchers to draw. Sixtly and laſtly, they, and they onely, haue the comfortable preſence of God to refreſh them, euen as the Sunne doth the earth: how then can it poſſibly be, but they muſt haue ioy?</p>
               <p>Againe, if it were ſo, that they haue no ioy, why doth the Lord command them to reioyce, yea &amp; that alwaies, <hi>Reioyce alwayes, againe I ſay, reioyce.</hi> And why doth hee giue it ſo ſtrictly in charge to his <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16592:162"/>
them? <hi>Comfort you, comfort you, my people ſaith our God.</hi> And doe we not finde many examples in Scripture of ſuch as haue reioyced: and that in time of tribulation and affliction, when croſſes haue lien heauy vpon them? Surely if they haue reioyced at ſuch times we may well be perſwaded, they are not without ioy at other times and ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>But we ſee no ſuch matter in them. <hi>Anſwere.</hi> no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for <hi>the ſtranger ſhall not enter into his ioy,</hi> they ſhall not meddle with it, no nor indeede diſcerne it, for it is <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and muſt be diſcerned by the eie of faith, rather then with that of nature. And againe the obiects of his ioy are not <hi>Carnall,</hi> but <hi>Spirituall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Obiect. Anſw. Prou.</hi> 14.10. The ioy of the Godly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, therefore not diſcerned by the wicked. Obiects of a chriſtians ioy, are not Carnal but ſpirituall. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 21.9.</note> he doth not reioyce in carnall things as he did before his conuerſion; he hath now better obiects for his ioy, as, Firſt God, and then thoſe benefits which of his loue and mercy, flow from him to vs in Chriſt Ieſus. Now the ſtranger who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into this ioy thinkes, he hath no ioy becauſe it is not on wordly things as thers is. But wouldſt thou know his ioy? then practiſe for a while holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſes (for it cannot be knowne but by experience <hi>It paſſeth all vnderſtanding,</hi> none but he that feeles it knowes it) and then thou wilt change thy mind, and ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Goliahs ſword, None like to it giue it me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly is this ſoe that <hi>Regeneration doth not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our Ioy, nor any affection of the heart,</hi> then we ſee our <label type="milestone">

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:16592:178"/>
It is no good diſcretion, to rouze vp a Lyon, or to take a Beare by the tooth, or for to pluck a mad Dog by the eares, or to thruſt our hands into a Hornets neſt; much danger is likely to follow vpon ſuch like courſes. Oh that we could once learne this leſſon! that we would yeeld a litle, and forbeare a while incenſing others by our contradiction.

I hope you can tell how to apply it: Meddle not indiſcreetly, when coales are kindled, the blaſt of thy wings abate not the burning; it doth rather increaſe then quench: for a while forbeare, meddle no otherwiſe then by prayers to God: See thy owne peace and ſafetie in the freedome of thy thought, and ſilence of thy tongue:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7.</note>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> A man may lawfully ſpeake in his owne defence. <hi>Job</hi> 22.5. <hi>Iob</hi> 31. <hi>Acts</hi> 21.31.</note>
                  <hi>It is lawfull for a man to ſpeake in his owne defence, and make Apologie for himſelf, when he is falſly accuſed &amp; wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the wicked.</hi> Gods children haue ſhewed the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of this by their practiſe. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> being accuſed for cruelty, oppreſſion, hypocriſie, and many other ſins, maketh a ſolemne proteſtation of his integritie, and ſpeaketh in his owne defence at large. So <hi>Paul</hi> when he was in danger to be killed at Ieruſalem by the people, being reſcued by the cheife Captaine, ſpake for himſelf vnto the people,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.1.</note> ſaying: <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, heare yee my defence which I make now vnto you.</hi> And thus alſo did he plead his owne cauſe before the cheife Preiſts and Councell.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 23.1.</note> And ſo likewiſe when he was brought before the Gouernour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 24.10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 25.8.</note> he made Apologie for himſelfe. Thus did he alſo when he came before <hi>Feſtus;</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:16592:178"/>
openly profeſſing, <hi>that neither againſt the law of the Iewes,</hi>

                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 26.2.</note> 
                  <hi>neither against the Temple, nor yet againſt Caeſar, had he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended any thing at all.</hi> The like was his practiſe, when he was called before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and at many other times beſides. Thus the Primitiue Chriſtians, when they had bin ſlandered vnto the people for diſturbing the State, for adulterie, murther, and other horrible ſins and greiuous crimes; did vſually write Apologies, and put vp ſupplications vnto Princes, that they might defend themſelues in open audience. But what doe I ſpeake of theſe, when we haue Chriſt his example, (againſt which can be no exception taken) to proue the point? When the Iewes charged him to be a Samaritan,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.48, 49.</note> and that he had a Diuell, he makes anſwer for himſelfe: <hi>I haue not a Diuell; but I honour my Father, and yee doe diſhonour me:</hi> ſo in many other places, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.23. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.18, 19. Thus did he euer apologize for himſelfe, when it made for the glory of God, and the good of his hearers.</p>
               <p>The reaſons may be theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, if we ſhould not defend our ſelues, when we be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> thus falſely accuſed, we ſhould giue falſe teſtimonie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelues, and beare falſe witnes againſt our owne perſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the ſlanders which light on our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> perſons, redounds to the diſcredit of our profeſſion. How common a thing is it in theſe daies, to blame the profeſſion, for any one infirmitie in a profeſſor, though of weakneſſe it be committed? See (ſay they) this is the profeſſion; is it not a goodly one, who would beleeue what any of them ſay? Seeing then the profeſſion, and the cauſe of the Goſpell, is thereby endamaged, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs not to be ſilent in anſwering truly, when as our aduerſaries doe obiect againſt vs falſly.

               <p>And firſt this ſerueth for <hi>Admonition</hi> to vs all, that we <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> there doth meane ſuch a praiſing of our ſelues, wherein we cheifly aime at our owne glory: But this praiſing of our ſelues, which is for neceſſarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and wherein we ayme at Gods glory, and the Churches good, and not made for vaine oſtentation, is not there forbidden: When neceſſarie defence doth call for it and require it, a man may ſafely ſpeake in his owne praiſe, and yet be no tranſgreſſor of <hi>Solomons</hi> precept. Secondly, it ſufficeth for the truth of that and ſundry other prouerbes, if they be ordinarily &amp; vſually true, though not generally.</p>
